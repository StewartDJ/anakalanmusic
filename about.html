        <h1>MY STORY SO FAR</h1>
        <hr> 
        
<p> I was born on a Saturday morning on June 4th in 1994 and surprised my parents, who thought I was going to be a boy. That was the first of many surprises I have probably caused them during the twenty-six years of my existence. They named me Ana Nuša, which was a compromise between my mother wanting to name me Anuša and my father wanting the opposite. I grew up in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, in a house that was in the making for a good amount of my childhood. It wasn’t always clean and there was no space for a car in the garage, because we rarely threw things away. To me, it was the perfect house. </p>

<br>

<p>I got bullied a fair amount, and as any other millennium, I was fairly traumatized by things that don’t seem as bad as they were. I was always a chubby girl and I often felt like I don’t deserve to be loved because of that. Wow, this got really depressing all of a sudden. Well, despite all the fat shaming and developing eating disorders for life, I still think of my childhood as a happy one. I had parents and an older brother who loved me, a best friend, a stable life, and I managed the school years just fine. My parents never held back in supporting me in all the things I wanted to do, like horseback riding, swimming, dancing and music. </p>

<br> 

<p> My first experiences with stage were ballet school productions, which I stayed loyal to for over 15 years. It sounds silly now, but back then, these productions were the most important thing in the whole wide world. You better danced perfectly or else, your life was over. Unfortunately, series of shoulder injuries ended my dancing career, but the hunger for stage never stopped. </p>
  
<br>

<p>I was always a fan of words, languages, storytelling, and I was drawn to intellectuals. All of that combined, led me to the theatre. I never got involved in the theatre as a child and I didn’t really know much about it at the end of high school, but something was pushing me in that direction. I went to study Dramaturgy at the Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television, at the University of Ljubljana. I didn’t fully understand what the term “dramaturgy” meant, and to be honest, I still don’t. There was a class in that school, that was only dedicated to explaining that, but apparently, failed to enlighten me. If you can provide me a satisfying definition of the term, please, contact me! I’m not even kidding. Not only did I not understand my profession, I also felt lost and unaccepted in the theatre world of Slovenia. I had brief escapes, such as completing a term in Croatia and working in the National Puppet Theatre of Ljubljana, which to this day, is one of my favorite jobs I’ve ever done. 
</p>  <br> 

<p>
While I was trying to find myself as a theatre artist, music was waiting around the corner, just chilling. It was always a part of me, don’t get me wrong. When I was twelve, I discovered the Beatles and that absolutely changed my life. I learned English through their lyrics and they inspired me to write poetry. I had a Guns N Roses phase when I was thirteen (didn’t we all) and that inspired me to practice guitar. I fell in love with Bon Jovi at fourteen, which changed my wardrobe for the next few years. Yes, I was walking around my high school as a glam rocker from the 80s. Poetic artists like Simon and Garfunkel, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, who were introduced to me by my parents, had a huge impact on the musician I eventually became. In time, when I stopped being such a rebel, I fell in love with many contemporary artists as well. But, because I wasn’t a trained musician, I felt like a career in music was unreachable.  </p>
<br> <p>
Eventually, I walked right into the alley, where the music was waiting, and it said to me: “What are you waiting for? Just do it.” And I did. I had written all those songs and never showed them to anyone. At around the same time I made a decision to leave my country for a while and go study to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, in Los Angeles. To try out acting. Acting always seemed scary to me, but once I did it, I fell in love with it. So, I was leaving the country and had a career to follow, I had nothing to lose. I put together a band and organized a farewell concert with all of my original music. Little did I know, three years later I would be taking music more seriously than anything else and I’d still be playing with that same band whenever I’m in the country. <br>  </p>


<p>
Three years later is where I am now. A Slovenian musician, actor, writer and dramaturg (whatever that means) chasing dreams in the City of Angels. I’ve found many artists I feel in sync with, many communities that feel like home, but most importantly, I’ve found an audience I can speak to. It’s not as dramatic as the movies would portray it, but it sure feels like my life is on the right track. I filter the bad through my art, I accept the good with gratefulness, and every day, I’m excited to share more and more of my story with you.
